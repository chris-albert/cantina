# Cantina

This application is a WIP of an event sourced CQRS order/reservation service. This could be used to 
order tickets or food or products, the idea is that its generic enough to be used for anything that can 
be ordered or reserved.

## Goals
 - CQRS
 - Event Sourced
 - DDD
 - Hexagonal Architecture
 - Pure FP
